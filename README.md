This app is an online version of the game everyone loves...Rock Paper Scissors!
A player who decides to play rock will win if the computer has chosen scissors, but will lose if the computer choses paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
If both the user and the computer choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.<br>
